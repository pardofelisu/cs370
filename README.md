1) **Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

   For this project, the goal was to create code that integrates machine learning and reinforcement learning together to create an intelligent agent that can solve a simple treasure maze comprising of different movement types, obstructive walls, and the treasure itself. I implemented the deep Q-learning code to find the best possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward for the agent.
2) **Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
   
        -What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
   Computer scientists research and design solutions to solve complex software problems; this would include developing AI to simplify the software development process. This matters because technology is always evolving, and computer scientists are there to analyze and optimize these systems.
   
        -How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
   I approach problems with an open mind; I want to understand why the problem occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. After this, I try to document my problem solving process and the steps I take to solve the issue at hand to help me with future problems I may face.
   
        -What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
   My personal ethical responsibility to the end user and the organizations I work with is to be as honest and clear as possible. Working in the tech industry has taught me that communication is a persistent issue that pops up, so I like to ensure that there is a constant and open conversation happening between the developers and end user. This also helps with documenting the potential wants and needs from the users, too.
